# Voynich Manuscript Decoder

A Java application for analyzing and decrypting the Voynich manuscript using frequency analysis and Caesar cipher methods. Also includes Dictionaries for various languages
with common words in each language for cookbooks, poems and regular conversations. the code will tell you if any words from the 
dictionaries are detected

## Features
- Frequency analysis for multiple languages ~English, Italian, Latin, Spanish~
- Decryption using Caesar cipher brute force
- Read ciphertext input from a file
- Detect if any words from dictionary is in the cipher in English, Italian, Latin, and Spanish

## How to Use
1. Put the ciphertext in a file named "vciphertext.txt" in the projects folder
2. Run the program in IntelliJ
